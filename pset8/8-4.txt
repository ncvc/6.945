The *done* value must be returned in the same manner as all other nodes of the tree are returned. Otherwise, all calls to acs-coroutine-same-fringe? return false. This is because at the end of the tree traversal, the last call to f1 returns *done*, while the last call to f2 returns the first element of the second tree - the *done* value is not properly yielded back to the caller of f2.
